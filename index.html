			<center><p>Node.js has a designed that is based around one fundamental concept: to build scalable network applications. Node.js is built as an asynchronous event driven framework, basically meaning that within this type of framework, data can be transmitted intermittently rather than in a steady stream. Node is excellent when using I/O bound applications or those that wait on user events because of its design as an asynchronous event driven framework. This also means that many connections within an application can be handled concurrently. In the most basic sense, Node is JavaScript plus C/C++ that allow for things like filesystem interaction, starting HTTp or TCP servers and so on. Node also comes as a package with a lot of additional features, such as npm which is a package manager. </p><br>
			<h3>What's the difference?</h3><br>
			<center><p>One of the main differences regarding Node versus traditional server side languages is that it’s built on top of Chrome’s JavaScript engine. This makes it a single-threaded and uses a concurrency model based on an event loop. This allows you to perform other tasks while waiting to be notified when the response is available and the application is not buffering data into memory but instead is outputting it piece-by-piece. Additionally this event loop system has libraries that are designed from the ground up to be non-blocking, an important and defining feature within Node.</p><br>
